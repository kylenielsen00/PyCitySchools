   The goal of this challenge was to analyize the standardized testing results from a large number of schools state-wide. The test results covered both Math and Reading from 9th to 12th grade and the purpose of this analysis was to see how removing test results from Thomas High School's 9th grade class affect the overall results we obtained from the assignment in module 4.
 
   We reanalyzed the following metrics after exluding the 9th-graders test results:

The District summary.
The school summary.
The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate.
The average reading score for each grade level from each school.
The average math score for each grade level from each school.
The scores by school spending per student, by school size and by school type.

  Once the results had been modified for potential academic dishonesty, we lost any data for the 9th grade at Thomas High School. The average scores for the district were not strongly shifted, but it decreases district-level scores slightly.
